    <h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
    <h2>ACT 1</h2>
    <h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
    <p>
      Two households, both alike in dignity,<br />
      In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, From ancient grudge break to
      new<br />
      mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the
      fatal<br />
      loins of these two foes A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br />
      Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Do with their death bury their<br />
      parents' strife. The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love, And
      the<br />
      continuance of their parents' rage, Which, but their children's end,<br />
      nought could remove, Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage; The
      which<br />
      if you with patient ears attend, What here shall miss, our toil shall<br />
      strive to mend.<br />
    </p>
    <h3>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h3>
    <p>
      Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords
      and<br />
      bucklers<br />
    </p>
    <h4>SAMPSON</h4>
    <p>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>
    <h4>GREGORY</h4>
    <p>No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
